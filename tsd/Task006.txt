Task006 - "hi" words

Task:
We have a sentence, where we need count how much "hi" words we found.
Be aware "fjehivv4" -> there isn't "hi" word, only " hi " we need

Example:

getHiWordsCount("hi HI Hi hI hehi hi mihi hi") -> 3

Naming:
Object name -> Task006
Method name -> getHiWordsCount(<string>) -> expect return number

Tips:
Look what the String.match() do
Don't forget if match doesn't found anything hi will return null
