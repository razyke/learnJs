Task002 - Alisa

Task:
We provide in array chars like ["A","l","i","s","a"] or like this ["A", "A", "s" , "W", "w", "Z", "t"]
In method(isAlisaCouldCreated) you should return answer(boolean) - could we create "Alisa" from characters or not?
true - if we can create.
false - if we can't.

Be aware, that one "A" in uppercase and another "a" in lowercase.
"Alisa" is key sensitive.

Naming:
Object name -> Task002
Method name -> isAlisaCouldCreated(<array>) -> expect return boolean
