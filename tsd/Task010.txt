Task010 - Sort names

Task:
We have array with names, but they are not sorted.
We should make function that will return sorted by names.

Example:
sortByNames(["Louis", "Abram", "Ray", "Bill"]) -> ["Abram", "Bill", "Louis", "Ray"]

Naming:
Object name -> Task010
Method name -> sortByNames(<array>) -> expect return sorted array
