Task003 - Even / Odd

Task:

We need sort our array on 2 arrays one has odd numbers and another has even numbers so method returns array witch has
two arrays 1-st even array and 2-nd odd array (splitOnEvenOdd).
But this is not all, after sort we need send it to method that will all even numbers summarize
and all odd numbers multiply in arrays, returning value will be sum of this arrays(getMagicNumber)

Naming:
Object name -> Task003
Method name -> splitOnEvenOdd(<array>) -> expect return array[[even numbers],[odd numbers]]
Method name -> getMagicNumber(<even array>, <odd array>) -> expect return one value

Tips:
Look what do method .push() in arrays.
