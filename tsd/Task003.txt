Task003 - Even / Odd

Task:
We need to sort our array on 2 arrays. One has odd numbers and another has even numbers.
Method returns 2 arrays: 1-st even array and 2-nd odd array (splitOnEvenOdd).

But this is not all after sort we need send it to the method that will summarize array with even numbers,
array with odd numbers will multiply.
Return sum of this values(getMagicNumber)

Naming:
Object name -> Task003
Method name -> splitOnEvenOdd(<array>) -> expect return array[[even numbers],[odd numbers]]
Method name -> getMagicNumber(<even array>, <odd array>) -> expect return one value

Tips:
Look what do method .push() in arrays.
